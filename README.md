# PSIDE â€“ Parallel Software for Implicit Differential Equations

This software is not my property. Further informations are provided in [Test Set for IVP Solvers](https://archimede.dm.uniba.it/~testset/testsetivpsolvers/).
I modified compilation and execution aiming a more user-friendly procedure. One can check how to perform tests in usage directory.

In the future I intend to improve PSIDE with new parallelism resources.
